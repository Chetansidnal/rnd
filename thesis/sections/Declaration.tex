I, Chetan Sidnal, declare that this Master Research and Development report titled, 'Autonomous Fault Diagnosis Framework for Robotics' and the work
presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize}

candidature for a master degree at this University.
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this report has previously been
submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the
source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this report is
entirely my own work.
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the report is based on work done by myself
jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.\\
